# Poject Local Library

A local library website with a complete database for users to be able to search books by title, author, genre, and other categories.
While others took care of the logistics and design, it was up to me to build the algorithms.

This project is designed to test my ability to work with large datasets and build algorithms based on those datasets. Before taking on this module, I had to be comfortable with the learning objectives listed below. I did not need to make any edits to HTML or CSS for this project.

### Learning Objectives

This project was designed to assess the following learning objectives, in addition to many others:

Use Visual Studio Code as a text editor.
Differentiate between the three most common JavaScript error types.
Solve bugs by using error messages.
Differentiate between let, const, and var, and use each appropriately.
Create an array from a string based on particular criteria and join arrays into strings.
Write strings that embed expressions using template literals.
Access all the values and keys of an object.
Use .find(), .filter(), .map(), .some(), and .every() to solve different problems.
Use .reduce() to solve different problems.
Use .sort() to sort arrays in various ways.

Use well-named variables, in particular avoiding any single letter variables that lack meaning.
Use native array methods like .find(), .filter(), .map(), and .reduce().
Make use of both function declarations and arrow functions.
Build helper functions when appropriate.
Make use of advanced JavaScript features like ternary operators, the spread operator, object shorthand, array and object destructuring, and for/in loops.
While working on this project you should not:

Change the names of the functions.
Edit any of the files outside of the public/src/ directory.
If you feel as though one of your solutions is working but something isn't showing up right on the site or in the tests, reach out for help.

### Datasets

There are three datasets that are a part of this project: accounts, authors, and books.

**Accounts**

You can view all of the accounts data inside of the public/data/ directory. 

An account represents a person who is registered with the library. Accounts can take out and return books.

**Authors**

You can view all of the authors data inside of the public/data/ directory. 

An author represents someone who wrote one or more books in the library.

**Books**

You can view all of the books data inside of the public/data/ directory. 

Each book represents a physical book but also contains additional information. In particular:

## Setup

To Run on your machine

fork and clone onto your machine

cd Project_Local_Library

**Run npm install.**
